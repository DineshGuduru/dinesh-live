                                I'm a passionate <strong>Data Engineer</strong> with over <strong>9 years of experience</strong> transforming raw data into powerful business insights through scalable platforms and cutting-edge cloud infrastructure. I excel at architecting enterprise-grade solutions using <strong>Apache Spark, Python, SQL, Snowflake, and AWS</strong>, empowering organizations to harness the full potential of their data ecosystems at petabyte scale.

                                Currently working at <strong>Deliveroo</strong>, I lead data platform initiatives that process massive amounts of data while ensuring robust governance and cost optimization. My journey has taken me through exciting roles at companies like <strong>Zoom, Rakuten, and IBM</strong>, where I've consistently delivered impactful solutions that drive business value.

                                But here's what truly excites me: <strong>teaching and sharing knowledge</strong>. I believe that the best way to grow is by helping others learn. That's why I create educational content on my <strong>YouTube channel "Atomic Engineering"</strong>, where I break down complex data engineering concepts into digestible, practical tutorials. Teaching has not only helped me solidify my own understanding but has also connected me with an amazing community of learners and fellow engineers.
